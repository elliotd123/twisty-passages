Twisty Passages - A simple rogue-like dungeon crawler
Copyright (C) 2014  Elliot Dronebarger

This program is currently designed to work only with the ncurses library.
To compile, you will need libncurses5-dev or other ncurses development
packages as necessary.

Install should be as simple as:
make
make install

assuming you have the g++ compiler installed. If you are using a
different compiler, you will need to edit the makefile accordingly.

This program is IN DEVELOPMENT. It is missing a lot of features
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are no monsters or items yet.
There are some bugs and things that need to be improved.

I appreciate any feedback or suggestions:
