Twisty Passages - A simple rogue-like dungeon crawler
Copyright (C) 2018  Elliot Dronebarger

This program is currently designed to work only with the ncurses library.
To compile, you will need the ncurses library and headers (ncurses-dev)

Install (You can create a build directory for a nice clean build):
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

This program is IN DEVELOPMENT. It is missing a lot of features
---------------------------------------------------------------
There are no monsters or items yet.
There are some bugs and things that need to be improved.

I appreciate any feedback or suggestions:
